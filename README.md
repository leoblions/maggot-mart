# Maggot Mart

You're a new associate in a convenience store in a run down part of town. The place is filthy and your manager has plenty of revolting tasks for you. But rent is due soon and you're still short. To make things all the better, giant mutant bugs have began attacking the town from who knows where like some cheesy monster movie. Better keep that bug spray handy!
